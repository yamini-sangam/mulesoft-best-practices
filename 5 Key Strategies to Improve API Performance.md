## 5 Key Strategies to Boost API Performance:

### 1. Pagination:
   - Fetch only what's needed to shrink response size.
   - Speed up content loading with page-wise delivery.

### 2. Asynchronous Processing:
   - Handle multiple tasks at once for better concurrency.
   - Keep user experience smooth with background task processing.

### 3. Caching:
   - Serve frequent requests quickly with pre-stored data.
   - Reduce server load by avoiding unnecessary database hits.

### 4. Connection Pooling:
   - Reuse database connections to lower overhead.
   - Scale up to handle more concurrent database interactions.

### 5. Load Balancing:
   - Spread requests across servers for reliability.
   - Maintain service consistency, even with server outages.
